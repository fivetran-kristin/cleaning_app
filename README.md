## Cleaning Business Website

For my bootcamp capstone project, I built a website and business managment tool for a local business, J&R Crystal Cleaning.  

## Motivation for Project
A good friend of mine has run a successful cleaning business for the last few years.  The growth of her business has been organic, and processes have been manual. 

Now she is looking to automate and scale her business.  This work will use technology to enable her to throw away that physical calendar, stop generating all invoices manually, and streamline that way she communicates with her clients and employees.
