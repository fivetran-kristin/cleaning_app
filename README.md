## Cleaning Business Website

Website and business managment tool for small business, J&R Crystal Cleaning.  

## Motivation for Project
A good friend of mine has run a successful cleaning business for the last few years.  The growth of her business has been organic, and processes have been manual. 

Now she is looking to automate and scale her business.  This work will use technology to enable her to throw away that physical calendar, stop generating all invoices manually, and streamline that way she communicates with her clients and employees.

## Problems to Solve:
- Current processes are manual, time-consuming & subject to human error:
- Invoicing and tracking payments
- Scheduling cleans
- Streamline employee management: This system should help hold employees accountable for work they commit to, as well as ensure quality of work is high & consistent.
